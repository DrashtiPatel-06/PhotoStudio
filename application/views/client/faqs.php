                                <h3 style="color:#c2a476;">1).Do you have an assistant?</h3>
                                My assistant photographer functions as both a photographer and an assistant. He or she is occasionally a second vantage point for some of the key moments of the day, while providing aid with lighting, organizing, and managing logistics of other key parts of the event.

                                <h3 style="color:#c2a476;">2).Can some of our photos be delivered in both black & white and color?</h3>
                                They can! ALL images are delivered in black and white AND in color! This way you can choose between the two!
                                <br><br>
                                <h3 style="color:#c2a476;">3).Can you hold a date for me?</h3>
                                I'm so sorry, but I can't hold the date or pencil you in. To be fair to everyone I can't "hold" a date without a retainer and a signed contract. I accept bookings on a first come/first served basis.
                                <br><br>
                                <h3 style="color:#c2a476;">4).How many pictures will we receive?</h3>
                                The number of photographs taken depends on many things - the number of guests, hours of coverage, types of events, hours of dancing, and so forth. My average for an eight hour day with a second photographer is 650 images, but those numbers may vary depending on the day itself. If you have questions about image quantity, I'd love to hear more about your plans! This would help me provide you with a more detailed explanation and estimate.
                                <h3 style="color:#c2a476;">5).When should we book you for our wedding?</h3>
                                ASAP. Since I can't "hold" dates or "pencil you in" dates are booked when...well, when they're booked. Most of my commissions contract me within a year of the wedding date, sometimes as close as two months prior, sometimes a full calendar year or more in advance. It's easy to predict what will be popular weekends, but not always easy to predict when those weekends will book up!
